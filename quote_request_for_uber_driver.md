Hi [Broker/Insurer],

I’m a California Uber driver seeking quotes with the coverages below.
Please price Good / Better / Best options and answer the yes/no questions inline.

Driver & Vehicle
	•	Name / DOB: [ ]
	•	License state: CA (valid) — years licensed: [ ]
	•	Address / Garaging ZIP: [ ]
	•	Vehicle: [Year Make Model], VIN [ ], financed/leased? [Y/N]
	•	Annual mileage: [ ] (rideshare [ ], personal [ ])
	•	Claims/violations last 5 years: [ ]
	•	Other drivers in household: [ ] (licensed? Y/N)

Coverage Request

1) Personal Auto with Rideshare (TNC) Endorsement
	•	Liability: ☐ 250/500/100 or ☐ $500,000 CSL
	•	Rideshare endorsement that covers Period-1 (app on, no match) including physical damage: YES/NO?
	•	Collision & Comprehensive with deductibles: ☐ $500/$500 ☐ $1,000/$1,000
	•	Rental reimbursement (rideshare use permitted): ☐ $40/day ☐ $60/day ☐ Other [ ] — rideshare OK? YES/NO
	•	Roadside assistance (rideshare OK): YES/NO?
	•	GAP coverage (if financed/leased): YES/NO? If “no,” can you place standalone GAP? YES/NO?

Confirm in writing (Period-1 specifics):
	•	Endorsement removes livery exclusions during app-on/no-match: YES/NO
	•	Physical damage (comp/coll) remains in force during Period-1: YES/NO
	•	Any mileage, time-of-day, or territory limits for rideshare: YES/NO (details)

⸻

2) UM/UIM (Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist)
	•	Limits requested: ☐ 250/500 or ☐ $500,000 CSL (highest available)
	•	Applies offline + Period-1 without exclusions: YES/NO
	•	Any set-offs/anti-stacking beyond standard CA language: YES/NO (explain)

3) Medical Payments (MedPay)
	•	Limits requested: ☐ $10,000 ☐ $25,000 (primary/excess over health insurance?): [ ]

⸻

4) Commercial (Personal) Umbrella that allows rideshare
	•	Limit: ☐ $1M ☐ $2M (quote both if possible)
	•	Umbrella does not exclude rideshare/TNC exposure when my personal auto is primary (offline/Period-1): YES/NO
	•	Underlying limit requirements: [ ]
	•	Any “livery/public conveyance” exclusions that would negate coverage: YES/NO (attach form)

I understand Uber carries its own commercial policy once a trip is accepted / on-trip. My goal is to be fully protected offline + Period-1, and to carry strong UM/UIM + MedPay given today’s gaps. Please attach specimen forms for all endorsements/exclusions you’re relying on.
