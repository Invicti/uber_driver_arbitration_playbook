# Uber Driver Arbitration Playbook

### 📘 Overview
This repository provides a clear, one-page guide explaining how Uber’s **driver arbitration clause** works, how to **opt out**, and what options remain if the 30‑day window has already passed.

The goal is to make sure drivers understand their rights under the **Platform Access Agreement (PAA)** and have a practical resource for documenting and preserving evidence related to deactivations or support issues.
