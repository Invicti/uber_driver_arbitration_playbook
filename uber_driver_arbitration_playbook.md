### What the clause means, how to opt out, and options if you missed the window

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ What the arbitration clause does (plain English)
- Most disputes must go to **individual arbitration (JAMS)**.
- No jury and no class/collective actions.
- You can still file with government agencies (EEOC, NLRB, etc.).
- Sexual assault/harassment claims may be filed in court if you choose.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ How to OPT OUT (official method) ‚Äî 30-day deadline
If you‚Äôre within 30 days of accepting the current agreement:
1. Send **one email from the same email on your driver account** to:
   **optout-portier@uber.com**
2. Include your:
   - Full name  
   - Phone number on account  
   - City/state of residence  
3. State clearly that you are **opting out of the Arbitration Provision** in Uber‚Äôs Platform Access Agreement.  
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Third parties (even lawyers) can‚Äôt send it for you.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ If you‚Äôre PAST 30 days
- **California:** Ask a CA employment/wage attorney about **PAGA standing after Adolph v. Uber** ‚Äî some aspects can remain in court.  
- **Statutory carve-outs:** SA/harassment claims can go to court; agency filings are allowed.  
- **Challenge enforceability:** Clickwrap, scope, or unconscionability arguments depend on your jurisdiction.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Practical steps NOW
- Save screenshots of odometer uploads, support chats, timestamps, license photos, and deactivation notices.  
- Keep a timeline of what happened for any JAMS filing or legal review.  
- If still within 30 days of the current agreement, **send your opt-out email today.**

## üìù Notes
- Opting out now doesn‚Äôt cancel any older arbitration agreements for earlier disputes.  
- JAMS rules apply unless the Platform Access Agreement (PAA) overrides them.  
- This document is **informational only** ‚Äî not legal advice. For individual cases, consult an employment attorney licensed in your state.
